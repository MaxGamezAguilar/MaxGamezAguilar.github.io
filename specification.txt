-----Lists the 10 HTML tags and 5 CSS properties youâ€™ve used,as well as a brief (one-sentence)
-----description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap.

html tags: h2 div ol il h1 strong em u br h3 h4 a

css selectors:
-h1 h2 body to change that specific html tag,
-class called .specified_text which aligns the text
-a[href*=".html"] which only changes the properties in links that are .html
-a:hover for all the hyperlinks they're changed to blue when you pass over them
-#main-title which means that html tags with this ID have changed properties.

Boostrap+javascript:
For boostrap i basically used its margins options, i used the properties class="ms-1 me-4",
they give you some margin in the left side and right side of the website.
For javascript what I did is a button which is in every corner of the subindex, and when you
click it, you're returned to the index.
